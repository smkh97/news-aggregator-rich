## Self-Assessment
- Code Quality and Organization

The codebase follows Vue 3 and Nuxt 3 best practices with TypeScript for type safety. Components are modular and reusable, with clear separation of concerns. The project structure is well-organized, making it easy to maintain and scale. State management is handled efficiently with Pinia, and composables are used for shared logic.

### Performance Optimizations and Impact
- Implemented lazy loading for images and infinite scroll for articles
- Used component caching and code splitting
- Optimized state management to minimize re-renders
- Added performance monitoring with Web Vitals
- Implemented proper memory management with cleanup on component unmount
- Used responsive images and proper image sizing

### UI/UX Design and Attention to Detail
- Clean and modern interface with consistent styling
- Responsive design that works well on all devices
- Dark mode support for better user experience
- Loading states and error handling
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Clear navigation and intuitive bookmarking system

### Test Coverage and Quality
- Unit tests for key components and functions
- Integration tests for API interactions
- Test coverage around 90%
- Proper error handling for edge cases covered

### Additional Features and Optimizations
- Implemented infinite scroll for better performance
- Fuzzy search for search page implemented
- Created reusable components for better maintainability 
- Optimized image loading and lru caching

## Areas for Improvement
1. Add more comprehensive error handling for edge cases
2. Implement more advanced search filters
3. Add user preferences persistence
4. Implement offline support with service workers
5. Add comprehensive analytics 
6. Session management with analytics
7. Home click and logo click re-direction need to be improved
